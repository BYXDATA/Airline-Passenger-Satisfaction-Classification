## 1. Introduction

This project aims to analyze **airline passenger satisfaction** using classification algorithms. The goal is to predict customer satisfaction based on flight and service data.

- **Objective**: Improve airline services, boost customer loyalty, and enhance overall satisfaction.

---

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset includes 25 attributes, such as **age**, **flight distance**, **seat comfort**, **Wi-Fi quality**, and **satisfaction levels**. Missing values and correlations were analyzed to clean and process the data.

---

## 3. Regression Models

We used **linear and nonlinear regression** to predict passenger satisfaction. The models were evaluated using **RMSE** and **R-squared** values.

---

## 4. Classification

We built classification models to predict satisfaction levels using features like service quality and comfort. The models were evaluated using **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, and **F-measure**.

---

## 5. Clustering

K-means clustering was applied to segment passengers into different groups based on loyalty and travel class, revealing insights into customer behavior.

---

## 6. Anomaly Detection

Outlier detection was performed to identify unusual patterns, particularly focusing on the relationship between **flight distance** and **age**.

---

## 7. PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce data dimensionality, revealing important relationships between different service factors.

---

## 8. Data Visualization

Visualizations highlighted key insights, such as differences in satisfaction between loyal and disloyal customers, and the impact of service factors on customer experience.
